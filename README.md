**Project Title:** 0x00. C - Hello, World

**Description:**

This project is part of a larger programming curriculum focused on low-level programming in the C language. The project consists of several tasks designed to help you become familiar with C programming concepts and tools. The main objectives of this project are:

1. **General Knowledge:** You'll learn about the history of C programming, its inventors (Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds), and the advantages of using C.

2. **Compilation Process:** You'll understand what happens when you compile a C program using the `gcc` compiler, including the role of the main function and entry point.

3. **Printing Text:** You'll learn how to print text to the screen using functions like `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.

4. **C Coding Style:** You'll become familiar with the official C coding style and how to check your code using the `betty` style checker.

5. **Header Files:** You'll learn how to include header files for standard library functions.

6. **Size of Data Types:** You'll write a program that prints the size of various data types.

**Requirements:**

- **C:** You are allowed to use editors such as `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` for C programming.

- **Compilation:** All C files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the `gcc` compiler with specific options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

- **Shell Scripts:** Shell scripts should also adhere to specific requirements, including the use of `#!/bin/bash` as the first line.

**Tasks:**

1. **0-preprocessor:** Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

2. **1-compiler:** Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link it, generating an object file with the same name as the C file but with the ".o" extension.

3. **2-assembler:** Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file with the same name as the C file but with the ".s" extension.

4. **3-name:** Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun."

5. **4-puts:** Write a C program that prints the text "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the `puts` function and returns 0.

6. **5-printf:** Write a C program that prints the text "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," using the `printf` function and returns 0.

7. **6-size:** Write a C program that prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on, following a specific format.

This project is a great starting point for learning C programming and getting familiar with the tools and concepts required for low-level programming.
